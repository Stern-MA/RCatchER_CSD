# Example seizure with CSD recording (processing and analysis)
Repository for code and data needed to process and analyze a representative recording of a seizure with post-ictal CSD.

Code was run on a 2019 MacBook Pro (iOS 13) with MATLAB 2020b
To install: clone the repository and add the dependencies directory to the MATLAB path (< 5 min)

Each main MATLAB script can be run in full or sequentially by section

Example_XCaMPYRCatchER_processing.m (expected runtime: < 2 min): generates a processed data file for use in the analysis script

Example_XCaMPYRCatchER_analysis.m (expected runtime: < 2 min): generates several key plots illustrating the analysis of the example recording
