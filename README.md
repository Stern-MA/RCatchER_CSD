# RCatchER_CSD
Repository for code related to investigating intracellular calcium dynamics during cortical spreading depolarizations and seizures.

The current versions of all code (pending full annotation and polishing upon publication) are available, as well as example data with executable code. The example demonstrates the processing to extract event times from a seizure recording with post-ictal CSD and to generate key individual representations of that data.

Terminal spreading depolarization recording and electrical stimulation induced CSD recording processing and analysis parallel the example as well.

Executable code and data for analysis of the anti-epileptic effect of CSD (Figure 6) is also posted.

Upon publication a link to an online archive with all the data and code for processing to generate the figures and other analysis included in the manuscript will be provided here.

Statistical analyses code can be found in the full code script RCatchERpaper_Figs.m for review.

The processing code is adapted from Stern et al. 2024 Neurophotonics 11(2):024202 (github repository: Stern-MA/2PCISz_RecDetect
